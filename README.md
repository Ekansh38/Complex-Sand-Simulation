# Complex Sand Simulation

This is a simple falling sand simulation with moisture.

## What does the base simulation do?

The user can place bits of sand in the sky and the sand will fall down and create semi realistic behavoir with falling down and forming a hill.

## How does moisture work?

You can pick the moisture of the sand your are about to drop and based on the moisture the sand will hold its shape stronger and not fall down as easily creating a more realistic simulation.

## Tools

The simulation was written in Golang with Raylib.
