# Complex Sand Simulation

This is a falling sand simulation with **moisture**.

## What does the base simulation do?

The user can place bits of sand in the sky and the sand will fall down and create semi realistic behavoir of falling down and **forming a hill**.

## How does moisture work?

You can pick the moisture of the sand your are about to drop and based on the moisture the sand will **hold its shape** better and not fall down as easily creating a more realistic simulation.

## Tools

The simulation was written in **Golang** with **Raylib**.
